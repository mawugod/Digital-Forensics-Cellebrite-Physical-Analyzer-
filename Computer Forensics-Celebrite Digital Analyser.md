# Detailed Analysis of SM-A320FL Galaxy A3 (2017) Image Using Cellebrite Physical Analyzer version 7.63.0.126

To open the Cellebrite analyzing tool for use in my analysis, I
navigated to the location \"[\\\\ELEMENT\\IsolatedDrive\\COMP40571
Computer Forensics\\Assessment2
2023\\UFED](file:///\\ELEMENT\IsolatedDrive\COMP40571%20Computer%20Forensics\Assessment2%202023\UFED)
Samsung GSM SM-A320FL Galaxy A3 (2017) 2023_10_27 (001)\", and selected
the \"EvidenceCollection\" software to load the Samsung phone's image.

Following the opening, a pop-up interface with name \"Case Wizard\" ,
\"Load Evidence\" showed up as seen in figure 1 below. I selected the
\"Next\" button.

The next interface that followed was the \"Examination tools\" interface
indicated in figure 2. I clicked on the \"Examine data\" button which
then loaded the various plugin to be used for the analysis as shown in
figure 3.

After loading, the next pop-up interface was about \"Device time zone
detected\" and it asked if I would like to adjust the timestamp to the
device time zone as seen in the figure below. I selected Yes.

Having loaded all the various plugins, I began the analysis by outlining
a timeline for the suspicious message conversations initially
established in chronological order. This method was used to examine the
step-by-step development and to understand and determine which
applications were used during the event. First attention was drawn to
the Messages tab. After a thorough examination of the Messages tab, I
noted the early warning signs of suspicion in each chat along with the
corresponding date. To do that, on the right-hand side of the screen, I
clicked on "Analyze Data" and then "Message". After compilation, these
results are shown for reference in Table 1.

: []{#_Toc155738659 .anchor}Table 1: My alleged suspicious initial
conversations from different messaging applications

After gathering a significant amount of data, as seen in Table 1 above,
and based on their timelines, it was determined that among all, the
first message was sent via the Native text messaging program. As such, I
began the analysis from there.

Having seen the first message from \"ASDAMobile,\" a proactive measure
for verification was carried out through an internet search. I searched
the question \"Is \'ASDAMobile\' an SMS name for ASDA\" in the Google
search box using the Edge browser. The result of the search is shown
graphically in Figure 1, which is included herewith as a screenshot.

<figure>

<figcaption><p><span id="_Toc155738601" class="anchor"></span>Figure 5:
A Screenshot of search result regarding ASDAMobile</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Subsequently, I navigated to the ASDA mobile website for further
scrutiny. There was no corresponding information or mention of
\"ASDAMobile\" found on the website. This observation is visually
captured in Figure 2, which is a snapshot of the webpage.

<figure>
<img src="media/image9.png" style="width:5.775in;height:2.675in" />
<figcaption><p><span id="_Toc155738602" class="anchor"></span>Figure 6:
A screenshot of a part of ASDA Mobile web page which was assesed to
ascertain the correctness of text message seen from the Sumsung
phone</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Quite suspicious, I tried doing further investigation by searching. I
came across this other website, [ASDA
mobile](https://mobile.asda.com/scoop/avoid-smartphone-online-scams)
which stated categorically that all communications from ASDA comes
through the short code "2732". A screenshot from the website is as seen
in figure 3.

In response to the detected anomaly, I conducted a more extensive
investigation. During this process, I discovered another information on
the [ASDA
mobile](https://mobile.asda.com/scoop/avoid-smartphone-online-scams)
website, where it was explicitly mentioned that all official
communications from ASDA are transmitted through the designated short
code \"2732.\" Figure 3 illustrates a screenshot extracted from the
identified website, providing verifiable evidence of this communication
protocol.

<figure>
<img src="media/image10.png" style="width:5in;height:1.7in" />
<figcaption><p><span id="_Toc155738603" class="anchor"></span>Figure 7:
A screenshot of ASDA Mobile notifying users about scam
messages</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The cumulative findings suggest a high probability of Smishing (also
known as SMS phishing) attacks. Significant doubt is aroused by the
official ASDA mobile website\'s lack of mention of \"ASDAMobile\" and
the confirmation from another  part of  the ASDA mobile website that the
official short code for communications is \"2732\". This disparity is
supported by the notion that the message was part of a Smishing attempt,
suggesting that it may have been a misleading ploy.

Upon scrutinizing another text message, it was discovered that a message
had been saved in the Draft folder. The initiation of this message
occurred at the timestamp \"13/09/2023 15:57:37 (UTC+1)\" and was
purportedly sent by the owner of the phone, as depicted in Figure 4
below. The content of the message reads as follows: \"(uk4PDO6fESpq)
Google is verifying the phone# of this device as part of setup. Learn
more: <https://goo.gl/LHCS9W>.\" After an in-depth look, it was clear
that this message, which purports to be from the phone owner, was not an
official Google correspondence. The message, which was directed to the
phone number \"+447520601004\", raises suspicions of attempted
fraudulent activity. Given that it is meant to look like an official
Google communication and is deceptive, I found it reasonable to
categorize this as a type of Smishing message.

</figure>

Interested in discovering other related interactions between the
phone\'s owner and the designated receiver, \"+447520601004\", I copied
and pasted the number into the Cellebrite Physical Analyzer inquiry.
Three search results were subsequently obtained. I selected \"Show All\"
from the drop-down list of the search results. This displayed a
tab interface that showed a summary of the relevant information,as seen
in Figure 5.

Call Log. Notably, the event began with the sending of text messages and
to a phone conversation. This deduction is based on the analysis from
the timestamps, as detailed in Table 2, showing the timeframe between
the intended message and call made by the phone owner. In my opinion,
based on the evidences from figure 5 and table 2, the activity could be
planned.

Examining another message from the phone owner to the number
\"447537452528,\" with a timestamp of \"13/09/2023 15:57:42 (UTC+1),\"
revealed a message resembling the earlier one sent to the first
recipient. The content of this message reads as follows:
\"*(hfbWSgyNQT4G) Google is verifying the phone# of this device as part
of setup. Learn more: https://goo.gl/LHCS9W.*\" This mirrors the
characteristics of a potential smishing attack, as Google typically does
not send messages of this nature from personal numbers. Moreover, the
sender\'s identity being the phone owner adds to the suspicion. Figure 6
provides a visual representation of the screenshot capturing this
message.

</figure>

Having copied the phone number \"447537452528\" and pasted it in the
Cellebrite Analyzer\'s search bar, no relevant results were returned.
Despite the absence of other engagements or information associated with
the particular phone number from the Cellebrite Analyzer results, the
isolated nature of this inquiry may suggest that further investigative
measures could be explored to obtain a comprehensive understanding of
the interactions and activities related to this specific contact.

Examining another SMS timestamped at \"13/09/2023 16:25:59 (UTC+1),\" a
message was seen stating, \"Your Asda Mobile activation code is:
506332.\". This message purported to be from the phone number
\"+447782502732\" to the owner of the mobile phone. The content and
origin of the message raise suspicions, as communications from ASDA
should ideally have an official customized SMS name. The use of a
personal phone number for such a message strongly indicates a potential
smishing attack, further emphasizing the need for a thorough
investigation into this matter. A screenshot of the image is shown in
figure 7 below.

I opened two additional messages, one from \"2732\" and the other from
\"FACEBOOK,\" which appear to be authentic. Figures 8 and 9 provide
visual representations of these messages. Upon further inspection of the
URL associated with the \"2732\" message, it was confirmed to lead to an
ASDA mobile website. Additionally, my personal confirmation of having
received similar messages from Facebook aligns with the expected
behavior for the message from \"FACEBOOK.\"

In a different text exchange, a dialogue unfolded between Tom (the
phone\'s owner) and Katie. As I delved into the message flow, I
speculated that they might have engaged in a prior conversation,
potentially on alternate platforms. In investigating further, I
initiated an analysis using the initial timestamp from the conversation,
recorded as \"14/09/2023 11:34:12 (UTC+1).\" I extracted and pasted a
segment of this timestamp into the Cellebrite search bar to explore
activities within that time of conversation. The search query I used was
\"14/09/2023 11,\" which was derived from the SMS conversation
timestamp. I refined the search by excluding seconds and minutes,
focusing solely on the hour and date. Upon selecting \"Show ALL,\" a new
tab opened, presenting the search results. This approach allowed me to
capture any relevant events that occurred during that specific
timeframe. Figure 10 provides a snapshot displaying part of the outcomes
of the search and detailing the activities that transpired within that
temporal window.

Figure 11 is a screenshot illustrating a Facebook conversation extracted
from the search results. This conversation, discovered under Chats,
sheds light on the initial interaction between Tom and Katie. It appears
that this Facebook conversation is the context in which they exchanged
contact information.

In the Facebook exchange partly depicted in Figure 11, Tom Biddle, the
phone owner, came across a profile picture of her on match.com. Upon
investigating the site through a Google search, it became evident that
match.com is a dating platform. Prompted by this discovery, I promptly
conducted a keyword search for \"match.com\" to explore if any pertinent
information would surface. The search yielded a total of 1143 items,
predominantly sourced from web history. This substantiates the
observation that Tom had been active on the \"match.com\" site. The
details of this search result are illustrated in Figure 12 below.

alleged to have used.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

After successfully tracing the origin and trajectory of the
conversation, I redirected my attention to the SMS messages. The
exchange brought to light that Katie mentioned she was not the person
Tom believed her to be, and she suggested the capability to fulfill
Tom\'s dreams. Tom responded to the message by saying "Girls?". Katie
then suggested to Tom to talk on a more secure platform and would be
sending her some instructions via email which he must follow. That was
when Tom sent his email identity to Katie. Analyzing these messages, it
became apparent that Tom's primary interest lay in connecting with
females. This revelation occurred at the timestamp \"14/09/2023 11:47:28
(UTC+1)\". Figure 13 below provides a visual representation of the SMS
chat between Tom and Katie.

Having noted the timestamp, which was the time the SMS was sent to
Katie, I switched to Email and located emails from that time and started
reading email conversations. An email appeared to be sent from Kate
Cameron. In the email, the timestamp was "14/09/2023 16:53:03(UTC+1)",
and was around the same time Tom sent his email Identity to Katie via
SMS chat. This is an email from Katie to Tom. In the email she asked him
to install an application called "Pixelknot", where he could open images
that includes textual information hidden inside. She also noted the
password to use with the application to be able to see hidden the
contents as "Katie" and asked him to delete the email, which he did.
Figure 14 shows the email conversation and noted as a deleted email.

</figure>

To confirm the installation of the Pixelknot application, I conducted a
search by typing Pixelknot in the search bar of the Cellebrite analyzer.
The search results indeed confirmed the presence of the Pixelknot
application on the phone. Figure 15 below is a screenshot illustrating
the existence of the installed Pixelknot application.

</figure>

In another email that I accessed; Kate sent an attachment containing an
image. This image, as anticipated, required the Pixelknot application
for decryption. To retrieve the image, I scrolled down and clicked on
the Save icon positioned at the bottom right side within the Cellebrite
interface. Subsequently, I copied the image to my phone and accessed it
through the Pixelknot application. Upon opening the Pixelknot
application, a password prompt appeared. I entered the password
\"Katie,\" which successfully unveiled the concealed message within the
image. Figure 16 is a screenshot of the content of the image that was
revealed. The content says \"*I can supply girls. Minimum rental is for
3 days*\". Table 3 contains some valuable information from the mail.

steganography\" application to reveal hidden information, I proceeded to
download the photos and transferred them to my phone. Afterwards, I
obtained the Stephanie steganography application from the Google Play
Store and initiated its usage to unveil the concealed content. Upon
opening the Stephanie steganography application, I encountered a welcome
interface with two buttons, namely \"Conceal\" and \"Reveal.\" Opting
for the \"Reveal\" function, another interface appeared, prompting me to
select an image by tapping on the \"Select image\" button. Navigating to
the images' location, I made the selection, leading to a new interface
having a \"Change image\" button at the top and a \"Reveal\" button at
the bottom. Tapping on the \"Reveal\" button initiated the process. The
outcomes of this process, including pictures and screenshots depicting
the outputs of the Stephanie steganography tool, are detailed in table
8.

The Stephanie steganography tool could not reveal the secrets. It shows
as an audio but unable to open and play the audio.

In a separate email exchange between Tom and Kate, as outlined in the
details provided in the table below, there was an attached image.
Employing a similar procedure, I downloaded the image by selecting the
Save button, transferred it to my phone, and attempted to unveil its
contents using the Stephanie application. However, the Stephanie
application did not yield any meaningful output. Subsequently, I turned
to the Pixelknot application. After entering the password, the
application successfully revealed a message: \"Seven, please. As soon as
possible.\".

  : []{#_Toc155738668 .anchor}Table 10: Emails data between Katie and
  Tom

To get the right image, I selected the one with detail in my analysis
below. I compared the timestamp of the result against that of the email.

Email was received: 26/09/2023 13:27:18(UTC+1).

The image from the search results was located in the following path:
\"USERDATA
(ExtX)/Root/data/info.guardianproject.pixelknot/cache/pixelknot_selected_35507598-9ec6-4078-a2ea-d13195e0debe.jpg.\"
The name of the picture is
\"pixelknot_selected_35507598-9ec6-4078-a2ea-d13195e0debe.jpg,\" and it
bears a timestamp of 26/09/2023 13:36:10 (UTC+1).

The dates for both the email and the image in the search result tab
coincided with a slight time discrepancy. It appears evident that Tom
downloaded the image shortly after the email was sent, based on the
minor time gap. According to my analysis, after downloading the picture,
Tom utilized the Pixelknot application to unveil the concealed content
within the image. The cache of the Pixelknot application then stored a
copy of the image, explaining why it is accessible in the specified path
above. This confirmed that the image in question is indeed the exact one
that is being examined. I then downloaded the image and copied it onto
my phone and used Pixelknot to unhide the content. The content hidden in
the image says "S*even it is. Be at the east end of Canal Street in
Manchester at 10am tomorrow. A man will arrive with her. You will walk
down Canal Street and he will leave you with her. He will run your
credit card. £180 per day. Contact us when you are done for return
arrangements*". This was certainly a response to the earlier message.

In different other emails, I observed he was on two dating platforms
which emails were "match@e1.match.com" and
<no-reply@emails.internationalcupid.com>. From one of the
InternationalCupid emails, was sent an email regarding some person named
Kaddy who liked him, sort of showed interest in Tom. I have included a
screenshot of the message from Kaddy, notified by match.com who showed
interest in him in the figure 22 below.

## Notes Tab

While navigating through the Cellebrite tool, I accessed the \"Analyzed
Data\" menu bar on the left side. I then clicked on \"Memo\" under
\"Analyzed Data,\" and in its drop-down menu, I selected \"Notes\" and
further chose \"Samsung Notes.\" Within the Samsung Notes, I encountered
some text that appeared as follows: \"Magip Ctkmid 10af. Jvsnz kvodbb
gkrw.\" The data appeared to be encrypted. The content and metadata of
this Note is detailed in Table 11.

Convinced that the Note held significance, I extracted a portion of the
timestamp, specifically \"26/09/2023 13,\" representing the date and
hour of the Note\'s creation. This information was then pasted into the
search bar of the Cellebrite tool to uncover additional activities
conducted during that specific timeframe. The search yielded diverse
results, prompting me to click on the \"Show All\" button for a
comprehensive view. This action opened a separate tab displaying all the
results, and I meticulously scanned through them in hopes of finding
pertinent information related to the content of the Note. Within the web
history results, a noteworthy entry stood out---Tom had conducted a
search for \"vigenere cipher\" on Google. The detailed outcomes of this
Vigenere cipher search are presented in Table 12.

  obtained from the keyword \"vigenere ciphere\" which Tom browsed with
  his phone.

From the search result and as indicated in table 12, I realized he was
trying to hide some information. Scrolling through the many pictures he
had on his phone, I came across a picture which gave me the Key he used
in encrypting the text to have what was in the note. This can be seen in
the figure 23 below. I opened the Vigenere cipher webpage, link in table
12. So I copied that same text that was in the note and pasted it in the
"VEGENERE CIPHERTEXT" textbox on the site, entered the Key as LEM and
clicked the "AUTOMATIC DECRYPTION" button. The result was "Canal Street
10am. Bring credit card.".

Upon successfully deciphering the encrypted message in the note, my
analysis, considering the timeframe between when Katie sent a
confirmation email (concealed in the image, as illustrated in Figure 21,
the metadata provided in Table 10) and the time of creating the note,
indicates that Tom\'s logical sequence of actions involved saving the
encrypted message in the note.

  : []{#_Toc155738672 .anchor}Table 14: Details of sites visited to
  download teenage girls' images.

The first image in table 14 above is supposedly the picture he used in
hiding the content before sending it to Katie.

## Images of underage girls

In the Cellebrite tool, from the home screen (Extraction Summary page),
under Contents, I clicked on Images to get access to various pictures
where I saw variety of pictures including underage girls. Figure 29
contains some screenshot pictures of some underage girls which were on
the phone. There were a few indecent pictures of young girls. An example
is one seen to the right of figure29.

# Findings and Inferences

Smishing Attempts: Evidence from the Messages tab strongly suggests
Smishing attempts, particularly in relation to ASDA Mobile and Google.

Illicit Activities: The decrypted messages, especially those hidden
within images, pointed towards potential illicit activities. The
involvement of credit cards raised concerns about illegal transactions.

Questionable Content Downloads: Browser logs revealed downloads of
images with questionable content. While the legality of the content may
vary, the nature of the downloads raises concerns about potential
violations of laws related to explicit or inappropriate material.

Questionable Images: Some pictures on the phone raises concerns
regarding pictures of young girls.

# Laws Broken

In tracing the whole scenario, it all started on match.com and then
moved to Facebook during which Tom got to know more of Katie. In the SMS
chat, Katie admitted faking her name and other details she must have had
on her profile. Considering section 2 of the Fraud Act (2006), which
talks about Fraud by false representation, and Kate having to fake her
details on her profile can be considered as having broken this rule.

The investigation revealed Smishing attempts impersonating ASDA Mobile
and Google. This raises concerns about smishing and deceptive practices.
This action makes it an offense to commit fraud by false representation.
If the message is attempting to deceive the recipients by falsely
representing himself as an official communiqué from Google and ASDA
Mobile for the purpose of gaining something of value, it could
potentially fall under Fraud Act 2006 under section as stated above.

As understood in a communication between Tom and Katie, she was to
supply girls to Tom based on the afore mentioned conversation that Tom
agrees to liking girls. This is what was understood from my analysis;
Katie was involved in recruiting, transporting, transferring, or
receiving girls for the purpose of exploitation, which Tom can be
considered as an accomplice, and this could be a violation of the Modern
Slavery Act 2015 (2015) under section 1 and 2 which talks about Slavery,
servitude and forced or compulsory labour and Human trafficking.

There were so many images of underage girls seen on the owner's phone
using the Cellebrite. But there were a few evidence of these pictures
being indecent and could be considered as being against or having broken
the Protection of Children Act 1978 (1978), section 1.

Lastly, it should be worth noting that since legal interpretations can
be complex, legal advice should be sought for a thorough understanding
of the recognized offenses and their consequences presented in the given
situations.
